# JuiceWRLDWeb

a. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I could have created a wifeframe to make the project a little easier in terms of having an idea of what I wanted the website to look like and where I wanted things to be. 

b. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
The most difficult part of the project for me is the styling (CSS). The nav bar took me forever to figure out why it wouldn't center on certain pages but on the other. I think if I would've 
created a wireframe I could've broken down the project into sections or did things in increments instead of hopping all over the place. 

c. What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
I would add a dropdown bar that plays different songs based on the song you selected. 

d. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
It would be a lot easier if you did things in increments because you wouldn't get lost in all the code and want to give up on the project. If you plan out the CSS it doesn't have to be that frustrating.
